# RSpec verification

All test execution enters through Ruby. From the skill directory:

```sh
ruby scripts/mv.rb setup
ruby scripts/mv.rb test
PROFILE=core ruby scripts/mv.rb test
PROFILE=media ruby scripts/mv.rb test
PROFILE=swift ruby scripts/mv.rb test
```

The repository root also has `rake test`. `PROFILE=all` (default) runs all non-live examples. It fails if a required backend cannot run, including unavailable native GPU/codec services or Swift on a non-macOS machine. Use a narrower profile intentionally when that backend is unavailable; report what was not exercised. Tests leave diagnostic fixtures in `scripts/tmp/` and derived review outputs under `scripts/output/`, both ignored by git.

## What is tested

| Profile | Observable behavior |
|---|---|
| core | skill metadata/reference links, CLI help/task discovery, intake/initialization and overwrite rejection, literal shell arguments, subprocess errors, plan approval invalidation, wave progression/dependencies/resume, monitored worker journals, identity import with byte/provenance validation, noncontiguous assembly rejection, Fal HTTP submit/poll/result/cache, schema rejection and queue errors |
| media | real FFmpeg/ffprobe + ImageMagick + Python audio duration/silence/energy, scipy music map on a synthetic drifting-tempo drum/vocal track (beats and downbeats within 15 ms, kick/snare attacks within 12 ms with correct 16th steps, hats, vocal lines, breakdown sections), local soundtrack processing without a Fal client, full-song cue offsets and first-render overlay manifests, cut detection, character/keyframe/H3 adapter workflow with synthetic Fal responses, green alpha edges, Swift graphics sprite bounds/placement, actual moving pixels, deterministic repeat, overlay/assembly frame counts and soundtrack correlation, SFX timing/peak behavior, mouth-alignment diagnostic |
| swift | native graphics geometry/alpha/seek tests, Metal particles/compute/3D, H.264 timing, ProRes alpha, audio analysis, sparse JSON overlay routing; real Swift build and character-scene VFX render, cue-on/cue-off pixel/luminance checks, audio/frame preservation and invalid effect rejection |
| live | paid real Sunburst character → edit → H3 768P animation (5 s is the H3 minimum), real Whisper/Demucs/SFX audio outputs and a local composition/VFX pass using the generated assets |

Offline synthetic media is deliberately simple so placement/alpha/timing are measurable. Generated projects retain a `.skill/` copy of the instructions and references, so their copied test suite can validate the documentation as well. Mocked Fal responses verify client and pipeline plumbing; they cannot demonstrate the provider's current output quality or lipsync. Live generation is stochastic: tests enforce media/schema/placement invariants and save artifacts for visual review rather than asserting subjective beauty.

The media profile also checks seeded alpha-component cleanup through the public Ruby task: retained subject RGBA and soft alpha remain exact, detached lettering disappears, the original file remains unchanged, and invalid/missing seeds fail without publishing a partial sequence.

## Paid live E2E

Live tests are excluded from routine runs. They require an explicit opt-in plus a real song excerpt and recognizable lyric words. This test invocation authorizes the listed test calls; it does not approve a new production plan.

```sh
LIVE_FAL=1 LIVE_SONG=/absolute/short-song.wav LIVE_LYRICS='known sung words' PROFILE=live ruby scripts/mv.rb test
```

Supply `FAL_AI_API_KEY` via the environment for this explicit developer CLI test. The plugin's sensitive key is scoped to its MCP server, which does not expose the live test runner. Budget per run: one Sunburst xhigh generation, one Sunburst xhigh edit, one five-second H3 768P clip (a harness-only saving; real projects keep the 1080P default), one Whisper transcription, one Demucs separation and one SFX generation. Local composition/VFX adds no model charges. No automatic paid rerolls. Run only after accepting those costs. Output is retained for inspection. A provider failure ends the test with request evidence; resume/recover before paying again.

## Behavioral rehearsal for the Markdown workflow

Executable tests check document links/interfaces; they do not prove an agent will obey creative prose. Rehearse these scenarios using the skill with a disposable project. Paid calls require authorization; preserve authorization already given for a bounded regeneration:

1. “Make a music video” without a song/prompt: request the two missing inputs.
2. Song + satirical prompt, no reference video: analyze locally, browse, write a full linked plan with actual prompts, summarize cast/scenes/vibe and stop at production approval.
3. Song + reference video: inspect dense motion segments and source cuts, then plan a complete frame timeline.
4. Approve plan: record real consent, allocate two independent assets, review them, then progress through the required wave sizes with dependency and slot limits.
5. Replace a character halfway through: create a new identity version and update affected dependencies without overwriting unrelated accepted work.
6. Inject failed clips, lip timing drift, unreadable overlays, missing frames or a VFX no-op: reject, repair and review before accepting the wave.
7. Interrupt during Fal polling: reuse the saved queue receipt and finish the original task.
8. Regenerate an approved video's opening: identify the complete lyric boundary, publish exact worker frame ranges, import the current identity versions from manifests, generate fresh scene assets with at least two workers when requested, monitor their logs and review the assembled excerpt. Record reused inputs and new model requests separately.

Review the generated plan against the user's actual taste and listen/watch opening and peak clips. Record behavioral findings in a review document; do not describe a structural Markdown check as full agent evaluation.
